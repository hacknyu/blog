Welcome to HackNYU's new tech blog! We've been working on various cool
projects such as the [HackNYU
website](https://github.com/hacknyu/website), a [cheating
detector](https://github.com/hacknyu/aletheia) and [this
blog](https://github.com/hacknyu/blog), so we figured we should write
up some of these projects. These write ups are going to be part
post-mortem, part highlighting the amazing work of the tech team, and
part an explanation of the work that goes into running the tech side
of an amazing hackathon. We hope that they're both interesting and
instructive.

For those who don't know, HackNYU is NYU's annual student-run
hackathon. It takes place simultaneously in New York, Shanghai and Abu
Dhabi. This year, HackNYU is on February 15-17th. The New York
location of HackNYU is the largest college hackathon in New York City.

The blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator
written in Go. The theme is [Bootstrap v4
Blog](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/).

We hope that you enjoy the blog!

Nicholas
